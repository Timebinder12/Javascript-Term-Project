The Online Games Readme File

General Information

To take advantage of all of the games that you can play, click on one of the games on the menu bar on the top right. There are three games to choose from, Chess, Canvas, and Tic-Tac-Toe. After clicking on one of the options, there will be a hidden information menu on left you can click. The information menu will contain all of the information to play the game. I will also summarize the rules in this document. 

Chess

This game is an online local player chess game. All of the pieces are arranged neatly at the bottom. To start the game, begin by dragging the pieces with your mouse and dropping them into place on the board. There are no rules and as a result, you can place pieces where ever you want. This will partly be a game of trust :) Note: It is pretty easy to get the queen and king mixed up. Remember: The Queen always goes on her own color.

Canvas

More Information coming soon...

Tic-Tac-Toe


This game is an online locally played tic-tac-toe game. That's right, we are taking you back to the 1990's where everyone had to share a screen! To play, click on a space on the tic-tac-toe board to claim it. Once a player has 3 spots filled vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, the player wins.
